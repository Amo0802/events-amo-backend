# NeoEvents Backend API

Hi! ðŸ˜Š This is the backend for my full-stack events app, NeoEvents. I originally built it to help people in my local area find and create events nearby â€” since there wasnâ€™t anything like it around here. The app lets users browse upcoming local events, save ones theyâ€™re interested in, and get notifications.

I planned to publish and market it properly, but due to lack of time and motivation, itâ€™s now mainly a portfolio project showcasing what I can do.

## What It Does

- Users can browse events, filter by city or category, and search.
- Users can submit event requests. To avoid spam, these are just requests â€” sent to me by email through SMTP.
- I (or anyone I give admin access) review these requests and create official events.
- Admin users get extra UI buttons that regular users donâ€™t see, like creating or editing events.
- If a user isnâ€™t logged in and tries to access some features, they get redirected to the login page.
- Itâ€™s an MVP but has solid features and could easily go live as is.
  
### Note:
Instead of local city names, the city filter uses an enum of European countries (like Spain, France, Germany) to make it more familiar for anyone reviewing my portfolio.

## Tech & Deployment

- Built with Spring Boot (Java 21), MySQL, and JWT-based security.
- Event images upload support, email notifications via SMTP, and caching with Caffeine for performance.
- Deployed on a VPS using Docker containers.
- CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and zero-downtime deployments.

## Local Setup

If you want to clone and run the backend locally, here are some essentials:

- Configure your application.properties with these variables:

```ini
# Dev Database
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dev_db
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=your_db_username
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your_db_password

# Mail (Gmail)
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

# JWT Config
JWT_SECRET=your_dev_jwt_secret_key
```

- Flyway will handle database migrations on startup.
  
- To make the first registered user an admin, change the admin flag to true in the registration service before the first user signs up.

---

## Docker Compose Notes

If you want to build with Docker Compose:

- Youâ€™ll need Docker Desktop installed.

- The provided `docker-compose.yml` includes Traefik as a reverse proxy for my domain setup. 

- If you want to run the app locally **without Traefik**, you must remove or comment out the `traefik` service and its related network from your `docker-compose.yml`.

- When running without Traefik, make sure your app service exposes ports directly (e.g., `ports: - "8080:8080"`) to access the backend.

```ini
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```
